# octoprint-ua-netinst

## Goals ##
I needed a quick way to flash and install RPis with Octoprint and mjpeg-streamer without the whole package of Raspbian. This is to be used together with [raspbian-ua-netinst](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst)

The installer works completly unanttended.

## What does it do?
* Overclock the PI to Turbo-Mode
* Install a few packages
* Install latest Octoprint from git
* ToDo: Install latest mjpeg-streamer from git
* Launch Octoprint and mjpeg-streamer after installation

## Misc
* Installatoin log: /var/log/octoprint-ua-netinst.log
